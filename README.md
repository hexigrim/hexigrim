- 👋 Hi, I’m @hexigrim, or Hexie/Hex for short!
- 👀 I’m interested in starting my mod creation journey! I have been absolutely astonished with what mod makers can accomplish, and I've decided to start learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Minecraft Forge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mods, potentially! I am always looking for ways to learn newer stuff and work with other creators!
- 📫 How to reach me ... my username is @/hexigrim on all platforms :)
